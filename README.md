# angular-bootstrap-minimum-app
Minimum folder and files structure to kick-start a new Angular.JS Project

It is supposed to be a simple project structure, without a lot of fluff. Just the bare minimum stuff in order to kick-start a 
brand new project. 

Many things that should otherwise be considered as mandatory for a minimum project, if not in here yet, it will be.

Some of the things that are already in mind, that up to this moment aren't contemplated:

1. Add Angular MaterialBower file;
2. Make Angular.js solution minified with GruntJS then saved to scripts folder
3. Minimum gesture and touch features mapped with HammerJS
4. Finish Karma.conf.js file so it can provide code-coverage
5. Feel free to add whatever you may thing would be good for a minimum project, keeping in mind that:
    * Please, no fluff
    * The features should be as agnostic of patterns as possible, the reason behind it is that we do not like Frankenstein's monster, so, if things start to become a mumble-jumble of different patterns, it will certainly start lacking personality.
    * Don't forget to follow the good old Push Request rule, otherwise, why bother even doing it in the first place, huh?
